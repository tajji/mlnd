    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three selected models are Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and AdaBoost Ensemble Method. All these techniques have inherent support for classification type problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real World Application: ** This model has been applied to the classification of handwritten digits, image recognition and in stock market modeling.\n",
    "Ref: Omid Rashnodi, Hedieh Sajedi and Mohammad Saniee, \"Persian Handwritten Digit Recognition using Support Vector Machines\", International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 – 8887) Volume 29– No.12, September 2011. Available: http://research.ijcaonline.org/volume29/number12/pxc3875193.pdf\n",
    "- **Strengths: ** SVM is most effective in high dimensional problems where there are clear linear or non-linear boundaries of separation in the data. The use of custom kernels allows defining complex higher order separation hyperplanes for classification. \n",
    "- **Weaknesses: ** In complex problems, the choice of kernels is not immediately apparent. The training phase for SVMs is slow on large datasets. SVM's may not perform well if the data is very noisy and has a lot of overlap.\n",
    "- **Candidacy: ** We have a binary classification problem which SVMs are good at. Even though we have a large dataset, the expectation of having a clear boundary between people earning above or below $50k makes this a good candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real World Application: ** Logistic Regression has been applied in many diverse fields including medical research and prediction of specific diseases, financial modeling for credit scores and revenue prediction.\n",
    "Ref: H. Yusuff, N. Mohamad, U.K. Ngah & A.S. Yahaya, \"Breast Cancer Analysis Using Logistic Regression\", IJRRAS Volume 10 – Issue 1, January 2012. Available: http://www.arpapress.com/volumes/vol10issue1/ijrras_10_1_02.pdf\n",
    "- **Strengths: ** Logistic Regression is a simple technique and easy to understand. It is fast and efficient for datasets which are clearly separable and have limited features. Because of its simplicity and intuitive approach, LR has been in used in many different fields for a variety of research and predictive models.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses: ** LR is not a great technique to capture complex relationships in data. The technique is based on strong assumptions of indepenency of features which are not always gauranteed. It also requires more data compared to other methods to achieve stable, meaningful results. LR models are prone to overfitting as a result of sampling bias.\n",
    "- **Candidacy: ** Logistic Regression is a baseline algorithm in most analysis. It is a good classification technique for a many problems and can be a suitable candidate for the problem at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost Ensemble Classifier\n",
    "- **Real World Application: ** Adaboost has been used for facial expression recognition systems among others. \n",

    "- **Strengths: ** Adaboost is a fast algorithm, agnostic to the underlying classifier and less prone to overfitting. During the iterative training, it continuously gives more weight to missclassified labels to allow the classifier to focus on the harder cases which increases the overall model's performance.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses: ** Noisy data and outliers in the data can negatively impact the performance so data pre processing is important. The model is also prone to overfitting if the base classifier is complex.\n",
    "- **Candidacy: ** Since our dataset is large and clean, AdaBoost can be a good candidate for the problem. Combined with the quick training iterations, AdaBoost can provide a good model that balances training speed and performance."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Reducing the number of features has a significant reduction the performance of the model, both in terms accuracy and F-score. Nevertheless, the performance is significantly better than the naive model tested in the beginning of this exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is most likely due to the fact that the classifier is not able to capture the complexity of the data and not able to generalize with the reduced feature set. The top 5 features contribute around 60% of the importance of all features. Picking a few more features out of a total of 13 might be a good middle ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I tested the performance with different number of features (not shown here) and found that the performance increases when the number is raised to 6 and remains almost flat up to 10. It rises again when the number of features is 11 and is very close to using the full feature set. The training time with less features is significantly better than with the full feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the training time is an important factor, two important selection points are top 6 features or top 11 features depending on how fast we want the algorithm to run. Both of these have some tradeoff for model performance but can be appropriate with the right expectations for the balance between performance and time.  \n"
